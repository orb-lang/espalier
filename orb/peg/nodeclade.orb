* Node Clade


  This is Mem, as it turns out.

#!lua
local Clade, Node = use ("cluster:clade", "espalier:peg/node")
#/lua

#!lua
local function postindex(tab, field)
   tab[field].tag = field
   return tab[field]
end
#/lua

#!lua
local contract = {postindex = postindex, seed_fn = true}
#/lua

We shouldn't have to pass the contract twice, on the one hand.

On the other hand, it has to /work/, and right now, we do have to.


#!lua
return Clade(Node, contract):extend(contract)
#/lua
