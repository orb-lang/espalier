* Vav


  Vav is an unbound collection of PEG rules, which may constitute a proper
Grammar.


** Rationale

  The various operations and rearrangements which I propose to perform on
PEGs is unrelated, in terms of implementation, to the use of that PEG through
binding it to some engine.

This is largely a matter of breaking the existing architecture down into its
constituent parts.
